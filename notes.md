Here's how a sample HTTP request gets sent to server through TCP

`GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:4221\r\nUser-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\n`

Each part of the request is seperated by `\r\n` escape characters that moves the cursor back to the left and on a newline. If we parse the above incoming request, then it can be broken down to the following:

```
// Request line
GET                          // HTTP method
/index.html                  // Request target
HTTP/1.1                     // HTTP version
\r\n                         // CRLF that marks the end of the request line

// Headers
Host: localhost:4221\r\n     // Header that specifies the server's host and port
User-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\n  // Header that describes the client's user agent
Accept: */*\r\n              // Header that specifies which media types the client can accept
\r\n                         // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

// Request body (empty)
```
